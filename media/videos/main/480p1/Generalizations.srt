1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,499
In this scene, we will explore some

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:06,212
fascinating generalizations of the Mandelbrot Set.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,020
These include the Multibrot Sets, the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,972
Tricorn, and the 4D Mandelbrot Set.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,996
First, let's look at the Multibrot Sets.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,172
The Multibrot Sets are a generalization of the

7
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:28,800
Mandelbrot Set, where the exponent in the iteration

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,860
formula is replaced with a diffrent degree.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,052
Observe how the fractal changes as we vary the exponent.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,140
Next, we explore the Tricorn sets.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,337
The Tricorn is generated using the iteration formula where the complex conjugate of

12
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:21,604
z is squared and added to c, instead of just z squared.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,652
Let's observe the changes as we vary the exponent here as well.
