00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,875
Here, we see a grid of Julia Sets, each

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:07,148
corresponding to a different point in the complex plane.

3
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,686
Observe how the Image changes as we

4
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:12,278
increase the resolution of the grid.

5
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:41,921
Now, if we zoom in on only the center pixel of the grid, we

6
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:47,078
can see how the mandelbrot set acts as a map for the Julia Sets.

7
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,635
for a point p, if the julia set of z^2 +

8
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:14,798
p is connected, then p is in the mandelbrot set.
