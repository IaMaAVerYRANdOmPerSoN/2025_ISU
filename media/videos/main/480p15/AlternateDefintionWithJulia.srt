00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,875
Here, we see a grid of Julia Sets, each

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:07,148
corresponding to a different point in the complex plane.

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:10,095
Observe how the Julia Sets vary as we

4
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:12,884
zoom out to reveal the entire grid.

5
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:27,071
Now, let's transform this grid of Julia Sets into the Mandelbrot

6
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:30,764
Set, which acts as a map for all these fractals.
