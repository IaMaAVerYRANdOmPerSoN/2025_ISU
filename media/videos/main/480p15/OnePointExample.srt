1
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:08,038
Let's visualize the orbit of a single point under

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,145
the iteration z equals z squared plus c.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,940
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,708
Moving from point 1 to point 2.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,540
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,332
Moving from point 2 to point 3.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,140
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,676
Returning to the starting point to complete the cycle.

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,473
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

10
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,241
Moving from point 1 to point 2.

11
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,073
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

12
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,865
Moving from point 2 to point 3.

13
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,673
Updating the point to its next value in the sequence.

14
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,209
Returning to the starting point to complete the cycle.
