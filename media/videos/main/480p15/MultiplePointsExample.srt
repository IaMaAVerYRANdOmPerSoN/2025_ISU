00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,438
This is the visualization of multiple points iterating under

2
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:09,388
the function z equals z squared plus c.

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,602
Now, let's explore the orbit of the

4
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:17,838
point c equals 0.335 minus 0.335 i.

5
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:26,182
Next, we move to the point c equals negative 0.2 minus 0.3 i.

6
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:36,494
Now, observe the behavior for c equals 0.33 plus 0.06 i.

7
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:44,958
Here is the orbit for c equals 0.5 plus 0.5 i.

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,310
Finally, we return to the origin, where c equals 0.
