00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,923
Here is the visualization of multiple points iterating

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:09,724
under our dynamic system, with thier orbits traced.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,844
Some points fall into stable cycles;

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,116
Other points aproach a attracting limit point;

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,766
Some points are attracted to a repelling limit point;

6
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,838
And some points just shoot of to infinity;

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,252
Or at some points, like the origin, the function is it's own inverse!
