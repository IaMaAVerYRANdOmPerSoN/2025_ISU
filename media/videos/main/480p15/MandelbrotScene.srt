00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,428
This is the Mandelbrot set, a fascinating fractal

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:07,604
that emerges from iterating a simple mathematical formula.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:15,174
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals 0.35 plus 0.35 i.

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:23,350
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals -0.10 plus 0.96 i.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:31,268
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals 0.00 plus 1.00 i.

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:39,489
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals -0.10 plus 0.75 i.

7
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:47,569
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals 0.00 plus 0.00 i.

8
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:55,606
Now, let's explore the orbit of the point c equals -0.34 plus 0.34 i.
