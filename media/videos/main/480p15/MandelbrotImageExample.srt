00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,964
How do you get the images?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,766
In older images, members of the Mandelbrot set are colored black, and

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:11,140
those not in the set are colored white, which looks like this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,660
Here is an example of such an image.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,667
Modern images use a color map to show the number of

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,837
iterations before divergence, assigning a color to each point based on

7
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:35,156
iterations to divergence, and coloring them black if they never diverge.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,012
Here is an example of a modern Mandelbrot set image.
