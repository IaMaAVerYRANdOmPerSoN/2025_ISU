What are Julia Sets?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,829
Julia Sets are fractals generated by iterating the function z

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,869
equals z squared plus c for a fixed complex number

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,668
c, starting from different initial values of z.

5
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:23,370
The Mandelbrot Set acts as a map for Julia Sets.

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,690
Each point in the Mandelbrot Set corresponds to a unique

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,859
Julia Set. Points inside the Mandelbrot Set produce connected Julia

8
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:39,108
Sets, while points outside produce infinitely disconnected, dust-like Julia Sets.

00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,636
Now, let's look at an example of a Julia Set.

10
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:54,724
Here is an example of a Julia Set for a specific value of c.

11
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:58,398
Now, let's explore how the Julia Set changes

12
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:00,582
as we vary the value of c.
