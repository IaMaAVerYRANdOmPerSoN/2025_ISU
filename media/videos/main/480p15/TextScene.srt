00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,036
What is the Mandelbrot Set?

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,797
The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers c

3
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:09,560
for which the function z equals z squared plus c

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,481
does not diverge when iterated from z equals zero.

5
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,009
Now, let's look at some example iterations.

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:28,502
Here are the first few iterations for a specific complex number.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,252
Iteration 6:

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,156
Iteration 7:

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,844
Iteration 8:

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,036
Iteration 9:

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,420
If the sequence remains bounded, c is in the Mandelbrot Set.
