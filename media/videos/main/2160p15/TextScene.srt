00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,036
What is the Mandelbrot Set?

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:05,799
The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers c

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:09,563
for which the function z equals z squared plus c

4
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:13,484
does not diverge when iterated from z equals zero.

5
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:22,012
Now, let's look at some example iterations.

6
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:28,548
Here are the first few iterations for a specific complex number.

7
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:52,465
If the sequence remains bounded, c is in the Mandelbrot Set.
