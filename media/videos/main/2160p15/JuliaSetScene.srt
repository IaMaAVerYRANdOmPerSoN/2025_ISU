What are Julia Sets?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,829
Julia Sets are fractals generated by iterating the function z

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,869
equals z squared plus c for a fixed complex number

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,668
c, starting from different initial values of z.

5
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:23,336
The Mandelbrot Set acts as a map for Julia Sets.

6
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:27,656
Each point in the Mandelbrot Set corresponds to a unique

7
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:32,824
Julia Set. Points inside the Mandelbrot Set produce connected Julia

8
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:39,073
Sets, while points outside produce infinitely disconnected, dust-like Julia Sets.

9
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:45,561
Now, let's look at an example of a Julia Set.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,588
Here is an example of a Julia Set for a specific value of c.

11
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,262
Now, let's explore how the Julia Set changes

12
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,446
as we vary the value of c.
