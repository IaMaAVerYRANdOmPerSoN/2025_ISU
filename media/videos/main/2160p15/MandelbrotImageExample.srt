How do you get the images?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,766
In older images, members of the Mandelbrot set are colored black, and

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:11,140
those not in the set are colored white, which looks like this.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,867
Modern images use a color map to show the number of

5
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:22,037
iterations before divergence, assigning a color to each point based on

6
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:27,356
iterations to divergence, and coloring them black if they never diverge.

00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,212
Here is an example of a modern Mandelbrot set image.
